# dotfiles
Because I'm sick of cloning settings between different instances

## Caveats
This is designed for Mac only. Please od not use this for anything else.
If you really need to use this all of a sudden for Linux, you should probably get rid of AT LEAST these files:
```
.yabairc
.skhdrc
```

## How to use

Run `install.sh`. You should probably read the code before doing so. Ideally, this should automatically drop a symlink for every single file located in this repository.
